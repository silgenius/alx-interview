# UTF-8 Validation

This project involves implementing a function to determine if a given data set represents valid UTF-8 encoding. The function checks a list of integers, where each integer represents a byte of data.

## Description

UTF-8 is a variable-length character encoding system that can represent characters using one to four bytes. The goal of this project is to create a function that validates whether a given list of integers conforms to the UTF-8 encoding standards.

### Function Prototype

```python
def validUTF8(data):
