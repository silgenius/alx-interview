# ALX Interview - Star Wars API

This repository contains a project developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. The project focuses on interacting with the [Star Wars API (SWAPI)](https://swapi.dev/), which provides data on various Star Wars films, characters, starships, vehicles, species, and planets.

## Project Overview

The `0x06-starwars_api` directory includes a Python script that retrieves and processes data from the Star Wars API. The goal of this project is to familiarize yourself with working with external APIs, sending HTTP requests, and processing JSON data.
